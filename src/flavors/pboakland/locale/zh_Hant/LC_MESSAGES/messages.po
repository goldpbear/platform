"<h2>How does PB work in Oakland?</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Participatory Budgeting (PB) is an innovative democratic process that gives "
"Oakland residents of City Council Districts 1 and 2 the power to set "
"priorities for how federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds "
"should be spent to improve low-to-moderate income communities in their "
"districts. The projects that receive the most votes up to the maximum dollar "
"amount will become the CDBG priorities for the district. In December and "
"January, residents came together at events in their districts and online to "
"discuss community needs and brainstorm ideas for funded projects that would "
"benefit low-to-moderate incomes communities. In early February, volunteer "
"budget delegates evaluated and prioritized those ideas and turned them into "
"the priority projects that will appear on the PB ballot from February 18-22, "
"2017.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Following the vote, the City of Oakland will release a Request for Proposals "
"(RFP), and city and non-profit agencies may apply for funds to implement "
"priority projects. Community Development District Board Members in Districts "
"1 and 2 will review all applications in response to the RFP and make "
"recommendations to the city on which should be funded. For more information "
